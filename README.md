In 2017 and 2019 a competion on [Post-OCR Text
Correction](https://sites.google.com/view/icdar2019-postcorrectionocr)
was organized. This repository contains my efforts in reproducing the
best results and possibly improving them.

## Install

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/jvdzwaan/ocrpostcorrection.git
cd ocrpostcorrection
pip install -e .
```

## How to use

In addition to the package, this repository provided two sets of
notebooks:

- `local` notebooks to be run locally, e.g., for generating datasets
- `colab` notebooks to be run on machines with a GPU, e.g., for training
  neural networks
